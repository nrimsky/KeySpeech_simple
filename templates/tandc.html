    <h3>Keyspeech Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>This privacy policy will explain how our organisation uses the personal data we collect from you

    <h4>What data do we collect from you?</h4>
    <p> When you register an account with us, we collect your username.</p>
    <p> When you use our web app to produce language board vocabulary, any personal
        identification information that is included in the audio file you supply us with could appear
        on the word frequency list. We recommend that you check all audio files before uploading
        to ensure that there is no information that could be used to identify any person featured in
        the recording, and that if the recording is taking place in a classroom you have been given
        consent to record by a parent or guardian for each student in the classroom.</p>
    <p> We do not store any of the audio files you upload, or any audio that is recorded through the
        in-app recording feature.</p>
    <h4>How will we use your data?</h4>
    <p> The data we collect from the audio files you supply us with is used to produce vocabulary
        lists that are intended for educational purposes only. We do not use this information for any
        other purposes.</p>
    <p> The data we collect when you register an account with us is used to identify you and manage
        your account.</p>
    <h4>How do we keep your data secure?</h4>
    <p> Any vocabulary lists that you save are stored securely on your personal account through our
        user registration system and are not visible to other users. You have the option to delete
        vocabulary lists at any point.</p>
    <p>The uploaded or recorded audio files are deleted after the vocabulary lists have been
        produced and are not saved on any servers.</p>
    <p>Only the most frequently used words are saved in the database. Any remaining transcribed
    language is deleted as soon as a word list is generated. This way you can clearly see all the
    words associated with your account.</p>
    <p> We will only access the microphone of your device for recording audio to produce language
        board vocabulary. When registering an account with us you can disable this feature by
        choosing not to give permission for your microphone to be accessed. You can change this
        option at any point in your browser's settings menu.</p>
    <p>We do not sell any of your personal data. </p>
